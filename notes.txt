What is the layout of the design? 
What buttons will I need?
Is there a way to have the all clear button be a part inside the calc keys div and not throw off the current layout?
all clear width was determined by calc width - button margin.

Add event listeners to the buttons?  
How do I console.log the number of each button?
How can I take the value of an HTML button number and have it show up on screen?
How will have that number show up in my calculator display screen?

What does Jonas and Wes have in terms of state managament in their courses?
How do I get a number on the screen when pressing a button?
Will I be using querySelectorAll?  What cases was querySelectorAll used prior?
Reference Jonas projects that may have some overlap.

Video 85 in Jonas Course might be a good reference for state managament.


Later will have button with event listener that will have add to the current state when clicked. Simlilar to othe operands

Can the buttons have more than one querySelector firing on them?
